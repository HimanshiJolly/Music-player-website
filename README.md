#Music-player-website

Project Overview
This is a basic music player website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player allows users to play, pause, skip, and control the volume of a limited set of pre-loaded songs. The goal of this project is to showcase a simple web-based music player with a sleek user interface and basic functionality.

Features
Play/Pause Functionality: Users can play and pause songs with a single click.
Song Progress Bar: A visual progress bar allows users to track and navigate through the song.
Previous/Next Buttons: Skip to the next or previous song in the playlist.
Volume Control: Adjust the volume using a slider.
Limited Playlist: A fixed set of songs is available for now, with room for future expansion.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the music player and playlist.
